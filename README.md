OPX FinalFrontier Ribbons

by arbsoup

Contains a set of Final Frontier ribbons for the Outer Planets Expansion mod series (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/225300-112x-planet-pack-outer-planets-expansion-opx/), by TheMinmusDerp and Interplanet Janet.

How to Use:
- Make sure you have GameData/Nereid/FinalFrontier installed already.
- Extract OPXFinalFrontier.zip into GameData, leaving you with a single directory, GameData/OPXFinalFrontier.
- You can remove some of the subdirectories inside it if you aren't using some of the OPX mods, but it's not necessary to.

Caution:
- As a third-party pack, this is not guaranteed to be up to date with changes in OPX.
- Also, look, I'm not a graphics person.
- Ribbon prestige may be broken, causing ribbons to display in "improper" order. I don't plan on doing too much to fix this unless Final Frontier switches to a Kopernicus-based or custom body hierarchy system or the like. If anything serious happens, let me know (arbsoup on KSP forum), but this should be pretty inconsequential.
