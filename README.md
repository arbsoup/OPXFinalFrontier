OPX FinalFrontier Ribbons

by arbsoup

How to Use:
- Extract OPXFinalFrontier.zip into GameData, leaving you with a single directory, GameData/OPXFinalFrontier.
- You can remove some of the subdirectories inside it if you aren't using some of the OPX mods, but it's not necessary to.

Caution:
- As a third-party pack, this is not guaranteed to be up to date with changes in OPX.
- Also, look, I'm not a graphics person.
- Ribbon prestige may be broken, causing ribbons to display in "improper" order. I don't plan on doing too much to fix this unless Final Frontier switches to a Kopernicus body-hierarchy ribbon order or something. If anything serious happens, let me know (arbsoup on KSP forum), but this should be pretty inconsequential.
