OPX FinalFrontier Ribbons

by arbsoup

Contains a set of Final Frontier ribbons for the Outer Planets Expansion mod series (https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/225300-112x-planet-pack-outer-planets-expansion-opx/), by TheMinmusDerp and Interplanet Janet. Unlike some ribbon packs, these do not need to be merged with Nereid/FinalFrontier, and can be added or removed easily.

How to Use:
- Make sure you have Nereid/FinalFrontier installed already.
- Place OPXFinalFrontier into GameData.
- You can remove some of the subdirectories inside it if you aren't using some of the OPX mods, but it's not necessary to.

Caution:
- As a third-party pack, this is not guaranteed to be up to date with changes in OPX.
- Also, look, I'm not a graphics person.
- Prestige numbering may cause ribbons to display in "improper" order on a Kerbal's ribbon list. I don't plan on doing too much to fix this unless Final Frontier switches to a Kopernicus-based or custom body hierarchy system or the like. If anything serious happens, let me know, but this should be pretty inconsequential.

Design Notes:
- Intentionally minimal and in the style of ribbons for stock/OPM/RSS: outer bands, (optional) middle bands, and an inner section, with the inner section being one coherent color and the bands either being single colors or stacks of three.
- Moons for the OPM gas giants get OPM's existing outer bands.
- Some moons have just the inner section, and some have middle bands too. There's no real reason that some don't get middle bands, it was just based on their most notable colors. There's a lot of grey and brown.
- "Pseudobody" moons get a little + sign on their outer bands.
- Planet ribbons normally have just an outer band and inner section, but nothing in these mods is large enough to warrant that â€” I don't feel like even the smaller dwarf planets would deserve it. So all the minor planets have a custom outer band for "orbits the Sun" that indicates their location and type:
	- Dot in the lower position
		- Orange: Inner-system (closer than main-belt)
		- Yellow: Main-belt asteroid
	- Dot in the middle position
		- Green: Jool trojan
		- Light blue: Urlum trojan
		- White: Centaur
	- Dot in the upper position: to be used for outer-system objects
- Minor planets either have just the inner section (always moonless), or have middle bands and an inner section (may or may not have moons). As with established ribbons for stock/OPM/RSS, moons of minor planets have stacked middle bands with their parent body's colors.
